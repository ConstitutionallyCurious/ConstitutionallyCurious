    <section class="card" id="article-i">
      <h2>Article I</h2>
      <h3>Section 1</h3>
      <p>
        All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The power to make laws now belongs to Congress, which will be split into a Senate and a House of Representatives.</span>
      <h3>Section 2</h3>
      <p>
        The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">There will be elections every 2 years for members of the House of Representatives. By having elections, members will be chosen by voters, and each state gets to decide who in their state deserves to vote.</span>
      <p>
        No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">To become a Representative, you have to be over 25 years old, be a citizen of the United States for at least seven years, and live in the state you are trying to represent.</span>
      <p>
        Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The Number of House seats and the amount each state is taxed are both based on the size of that state's population (states with a high amount of people pay more taxes and get to have more representatives in Congress). The population of each state is calculated by adding the number of free people, including slaves, as % of a person, and not counting Native Americans. Each state gets one House seat for every 30,000 people (as calculated by the formula above). Each state must have at least one House seat. Every ten years, all the states will recount their populations and their House seats and taxes will change. Using population to determine the number of representatives each state gets will not go into effect until three years after Congress's first meeting. For now, New Hampshire will have 3 seats, Massachusetts 8, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations 1, Connecticut 5, New York 6, New Jersey 4, Pennsylvania 8, Delaware 1, Maryland 6, Virginia 10, North Carolina 5, South Carolina 5, Georgia 3.</span>
      <p>
        When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">If a member of the House of Representatives from a state leaves their job (like if they quit or pass away), the governor of that state must hold a new election to choose someone else.</span>
      <p>
        The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The House of Representatives will choose its leader and other officers. Only the House will have the power to accuse a government official (like the President) of breaking the law by taking their power too far.</span>
      <h3>Section 3</h3>
      <p>
        The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The Senate will have 2 seats per state. State Legislatures (the rule-making team for each state) will choose their state's senators. They will be in the Senate for 6 years. Each senator will have one vote.</span>
      <p>
        Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year, and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">After the first election, the senators will be divided into three groups: Group 1 leaves after 2 years, Group 2 leaves after 4 years, and Group 3 leaves after 6 years. This way, every 2 years, one-third of the Senate gets re-elected instead of the entire Senate leaving at the same time. If a senator leaves their job early (like if they quit or pass away), the state legislature must choose a new senator. If the state legislature is not available, the governor of that state can choose someone temporarily until the state legislature is available.</span>
      <p>
        No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">To become a Senator, you have to be at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States for 9 years, and live in the state you are trying to represent.</span>
      <p>
        The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The Vice President will be in charge of the Senate, but doesn't get to vote in the Senate unless they need a tiebreaker.</span>
      <p>
        The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">The Senate will choose officers (assistants) and a "President pro tempore" to do the Vice President's job if they are absent or busy replacing the President.</span>
      <p>
        The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <h3>Section 4</h3>
      <p>
        The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <h3>Section 5</h3>
      <p>
        Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <h3>Section 6</h3>
      <p>
        The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <h3>Section 7</h3>
      <p>
        All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively, If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.
      </p>
      <span class="interpretation">[Interpretation for the above paragraph]</span>
      <p>
        Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.
